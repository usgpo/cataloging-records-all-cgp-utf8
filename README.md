The U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO) is making available all MARC bibliographic records (1,022,882 records) in the [Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP)](https://catalog.gpo.gov) as of March 30, 2022, with the exception of acquisition-level records, also known as brief bibs. The CGP is the U.S. Government Publishing Office's (GPO) finding tool for electronic and print publications from the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the U.S. Federal Government. These publications comprise the National Bibliography of U.S. Government Publications.

These files and the monthly CGP files in the [CGP MARC Records](https://github.com/usgpo/cataloging-records/tree/master/CGP_MARC_Records) collection essentially represent the entire CGP. GPO may periodically refresh the files in the All_CGP_Records collection with a new snapshot of the whole CGP.

The records are in UTF-8. The total size of the files is 1.87 GB (2,010,716,169 bytes). Each of the 26 files in the repository holds approximately 40,000 records.

These same records are available in MARCXML format from the [cataloging-records-all-cgp-marcxml](https://github.com/usgpo/cataloging-records-all-cgp-marcxml) repository.

To download the files, use the "Code" button in the right-hand section of this page and select "Download ZIP." The ZIP file contains all of the files in the repository.
